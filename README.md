## Shell Scripts

A collection of shell scripts to make setting up and sourcing environments in projects easier.

### Fuel Server Script

Make sure you have `Go` installed on your computer and have have the `fuelserver` repo cloned into your machine.

Follow the instructions to set up your environment.

To use this shellscript, `cd` into fuelserver

I have also included an example `.env` file inside `fuel_server` directory. You can copy them into the `.env.bash` file in the `fuelserver` project.

Run `sh ~/Shell-Scripts/fuel_env/fuel_server.sh`
